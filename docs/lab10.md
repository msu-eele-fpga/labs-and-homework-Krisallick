# Lab 10: Device Trees
# Overview
In this assignment we created a device tree for our custom LED-patterns "device" we also explored using sysfs and created a heartbeat via the user led on the de10nano board.

# Questions
1. The purpose of the device tree is to let the system know what hardware is available and how we can possibly use that hardware. Then the device driver can use that info to interact with that hardware.
