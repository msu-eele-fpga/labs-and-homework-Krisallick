# Hw 10: RGB LED Controller VHDL

# Overview
In this assignment, we created an RGB LED controller using the PWM controller we created in HW 8.

## Deliverables
### Current limiting resistances
Red: $\frac{3.3-2}{20mA}=65\Omega$

Green: $\frac{3.3-3}{20mA}=15\Omega$

Blue: $\frac{3.3-3}{20mA}=15\Omega$
